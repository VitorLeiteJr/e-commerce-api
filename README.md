You are required to build an API for an e-commerce platform. If you have developed the other projects in this roadmap, you will have to keep in mind everything you have learned so far:

JWT authentication to ensure many users can interact with it.
Implementing simple CRUD operations.
Interaction with external services. Here youâ€™ll be integrating with payment gateways such as Stripe.
A complex data model that can handle products, shopping carts, and more.
The goal of this project is to help you understand how to build a logic-heavy application with complex data models. You will also learn how to interact with external services and handle user authentication.
