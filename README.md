# E-Commerce Platform API

## Overview
You are required to build an API for an e-commerce platform. If you have developed the other projects in this roadmap, you will have to keep in mind everything you have learned so far:

- **JWT Authentication**: Ensure many users can interact with the API securely.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.
- **Interaction with External Services**: Integrate with payment gateways such as Stripe.
- **Complex Data Models**: Handle products, shopping carts, and more.

The goal of this project is to help you understand how to build a logic-heavy application with complex data models. You will also learn how to interact with external services and handle user authentication.
